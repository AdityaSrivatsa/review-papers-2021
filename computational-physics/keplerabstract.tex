Formation of circumbinary planets orbiting very close to the central stars, may occur in a very hostile environment due to very strong gravitational pull in the primordial protoplanetary disk.The primary contributors to high energy, potentially destructive collisions of planets are elevated impact velocities and orbit crossings from eccentricity oscillations. In the paper, they discussed about high-resolution, inter-particle gravity enabled N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in the Kepler-34 system. They found super-catastrophic erosion events and  migration from formation location of circumbinary planets with the possible exception of Kepler-47(AB)c.
