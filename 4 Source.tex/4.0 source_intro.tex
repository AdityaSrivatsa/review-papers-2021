Theory of general relativity predicts that gravitational waves can be generated by any dynamically changing system containing moving objects by producing radiation-reaction forces in their source i.e. waves will be generated and carries the exact rate of energy which is extracted from the source. 

Gravitational waves can be produced by an object which is accelerating or a Binary revolving system, merging black holes, neutron star collisions, primordial black holes, etc. But one common nature is all these objects is, they change the curvature of space-time. Thus radiate waves.
